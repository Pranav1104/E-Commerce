# ECommerce
Ecommerce, or electronic commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services online. An ecommerce project typically involves the development of a website or mobile app that allows customers to browse and purchase products or services, while also providing a platform for businesses to manage their online sales, inventory, and shipping. The project may also involve integrating payment gateways, implementing security measures, and optimizing the website for search engines to improve visibility and attract more customers. The ultimate goal of an ecommerce project is to provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers, while also increasing sales and revenue for businesses.
